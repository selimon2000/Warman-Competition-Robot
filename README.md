# Warman Compeition Robot

## About The Competition
Each semester the UTS subject Mechanical Design Fundamentals Studio 1 is run to test and grow an engineer's ability technically and cooperatively, by creating a solution for a problem based on a real life scenario.

In 2022, our project was to transport an object from one part of the table to the other side, without touching the middle of the table. This demonstrates the issue of transportation between chasms. There was a rope wire supported by 2 pylons as an option.

## Our Solution
Our solution involved having 2 systems
- 'Vehicle'
  - Had a 1DOF gripper to grip the object, and lift it
  - Had a Differential Drive design
 
- Gondola
  - Had a winch to pull the vehicle
  - Had wheels to traverse the steel rope
 
## Results
The robot worked and it was able to transport the object. However there were some design issues which was why it wasn't able to get full marks.

Being the first time I built something from the idea phase to the testing phase and the design phase, there were many things I learned in terms of teamwork which I have applied to my other projects so that I become more successful in my future R&D projects.

I have also improved my skills technically by doing more similar projects, which expanded my ideation and problem solving ability, and engineering intuition.
